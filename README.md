This repo is about detailed steps for reproducible research in computational science, including computational biology, immunogenomics, single-cell multi-omics data integration, and transformative research.

We recommend every lab member from the [Zhang Lab](https://fanzhanglab.org/) to first read through these documents to understand the contents, which will help you to have a productive and successful experience here.

:star: [**First Day in lab for new members**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/your_first_day.md): You should first read through this document and configure your server and computer with necessary software.

:star: [**Getting started with Alpine**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/main/Alpine_Help.md): This will help new members get aquainted with the CU Research Computing (CURC) High Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster.

:star: [**Handboook for reproducible computational research**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/reproducible_research.md): This handbook provides guidance of conducting reproducible computational research.

:star: [**Learning rescources**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/resource.md): 
- Have a read of [high-impact papers](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/main/resource.md) we organized covering *single-cell omics*, *statistical modeling*, *machine learning*, and *computational genomics* with code examples.
- Welcome to learn the tips of [writing grants](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/main/grant_writing.md).
 
 
:star: [**Lab principles**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/lab_principle.md): We believe in collaborations, encourage sharing, promote diversity, and maintain scientific integrity to pursue high-quality science.

:star: [**Lab activities**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/lab_activity.md): We manage our lab time in multiple meetings to help you gain great research skills and advance career development.

:star: [**Expectations and achievements**](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/master/for_trainee.md): To achieve your research goals, we highly encourage all lab members to submit abstracts, publish papers, and/or present our work in public.
