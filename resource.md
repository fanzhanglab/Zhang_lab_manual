# Learning resources for the Zhang Lab

It is exciting to become a Computational Biologist working in transformative research, which means you may become an expert in multiple hot fields: genomics, genetics, coding, statistics, machine learning, systems immunology, translational medicine, etc. I hope you select > 3 from these fields and dive deeper into them. 

<img src="https://github.com/fanzhanglab/Zhang_lab_manual/blob/main/fields.png" width="500" align="right">

Here, we list great papers and classical books that cover the key research topics in our lab. Many of them are "must read" :book: for our lab. *We are expanding this list and welcome any of our team members to contribute to this.* We hope these resources can guide you to start this exciting field and find out your own interests to make an impact!
