# Learning resources for the Zhang Lab

It is exciting to become a Computational Biologist working in transformative reserach, which means you may become an expert in multiple hot fields: genomics, genetics, coding, statistics, machine learning, systems immunology, and translational medicine, etc. I hope you select > 3 from these fields and dive deeper into them.

Here I tried to list great papers and classical books that cover the key research topics in our lab. Many of them are "must read" for our lab. *We are expanding this list and welcome any of our team members to contribute to this.* We hope these resources could guide you to start this exciting field and find out your own interests to make an impact!
