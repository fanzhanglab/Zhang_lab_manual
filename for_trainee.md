# Expectations and achievements

To achieve your reserach goals and maintain productivity, we expect all lab members to submit abstracts, publish papers, apply for grant, and/or give talks at international, national, and local conferences.
We develop publishable and impactful independent and collaborative projects to help you become an independent computational scientist and be successful for your next career stage.
We are always interested in recuirting motivated and dedicated folks at all levels. 


Expectations of Undergraduate Students
-----
- We design measuable and publishable projects for every undergraduate student based on their interests.
We definitely maximize the possibility to publish your work in the lab even though you may spend a relatively shorter time (like 3 months or summer volunteeer work).
- Through doing projects in lab, every undergraduate student has many opportunities to gain new skills like computational modeling, data analaysis and integration, critical thinking from the translational medicine perspective, etc.
- You are expected to communicate about research questions and approaches with everyone in the lab and work hard. 
- You are very welcomed to come back and continue working with us for your graduate reserach.


Expectations of Graduate Students 
-----
- Prof. Zhang will develop a development plan with each graduate student and rotation student together based on everyone's backgrounds and goals.
- Prof. Zhang will supervise everyone's research projects through one-on-one meetings, daily research communications, lab meetings, etc.
You are welcome to schedule more meetings with Prof. Zhang if needed.
- Graduating with a PhD from the Zhang Lab will generally need publish 3 publications as lead (first or co-first) author in the fields of computational and systems biology,
computational method or pipeline development, novel biology findings in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.
- Of course Prof. Zhang will guide you and expect you to pass your qualifying exams and thesis defense.
You'll be asked question throughout your exam. A good way to answer a question you don't immediately know the answer to is: "We’ll see. We'll do X experiment. We have to look at the data and see if X is _____. If so, we’ll do _____, if not, we’ll do _______."
- We aim to help you become an independent computational scientist and also a good team player, and you will be ready to move on to your next step's career.


 
Expectations of Postdoc Fellows
----
- Postdocs are incentivized to reach career milestones and publish papers and dive into a specific reserach question deeply. 
Please feel free to communicate with Prof. Zhang on your thoughts on your current projects, future skills you'd like to develop, your long-term career goals. 
- It usually takes one or two years to publish your first first-authored paper and send your second first/co-first authored paper for review on the second or third year.
- Once you submit your first first-authored paper, please seek out opportunities to present your work to the national and/or international community to communicate with more folks in simiar fields and broaden your horizons. 
- We highly encourage postdoc fellows to write grant proposals and apply for external fundings.
- As a postdoc fellow, demonstrating your independence, leadership, and mentoring capability is important to move on to your next career stage in either academia or industry.
Prof. Zhang would like to introduce you to other collaboration projects if you have the bandwith (if you can make good progress on your independent projects) in order to enhance your expertise of leading a multi-site systems biology project if available.
- We recommend you considering looking for academic jobs when your second paper is sent for review.
- For job application, please consult with Prof. Zhang on your application materials, recommendation letter, and job talk rehearsal as she can provide considerable assistance in this regard.

Prof. Zhang is happy to help revise your manuscript and abstract drafts and provide detailed guidance on presentations.



Publishing a paper
-------
- We perform publishing-driven and impactful reserach.
We aim to thoughtfully solve at least one scientific problem and overcome a computational biology challenge in one paper.
- For a computational biology or method development paper, we need to perform reasonable benchmarking on multiple real-world diseased datasets and method comparison on existing approaches in the field. As outcomes, we recommend to make the method/tool generalizable in multiple similar fields to benefit the whole computational immunology and inflammatory disease fields.
- For biology- or disease-driven paper, we need to generate statistical robust conclusions through accurate data modeling.
We aim to not only generate analyses or pipelines, but also a testable hypothesis with reproducible coding to further communicate with other immunologists and rheumatologists to gain translational medicine impact.
- [More to come]



Presenting your research
-------
Once your work has been selected for an oral talk, you need to prepare your presentation and do rehersals once in the lab. This can help you enhance your logic, manage presenting timing, practice question handling skills, and build your confidence.
