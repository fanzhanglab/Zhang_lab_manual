To achieve our research goals and maintain high productivity, we expect all lab members to push beyond their comfort zones, connect ideas across disciplines, and think deeply about the “why” behind their work—especially as it relates to the specific questions (either computational or biological) driving their projects. We aim to cultivate both independent and collaborative, publication-ready projects that will help you grow into an **independent computational scientist** and position you for success in your next career stage. We are always eager to recruit **highly motivated and dedicated** individuals at all levels.



Expectations of Graduate Students 
-----
- I will develop a detailed plan with each graduate student and rotation student together based on everyone's interests and goals.
- I will supervise everyone's research projects through one-on-one meetings, daily research communications, lab meetings, etc.
- Graduating with a PhD from the Zhang Lab will generally need publish at least 2 publications as lead (first or co-first) author in the fields of computational biology, systems immunology, computational method development, novel translational findings.
- I will guide you and expect you to pass your qualifying exams and thesis defense.
- I will help you develop proposals for NIH F30/F31 grants, NIH T32 or T15 grants.
- I aim to help you become an independent computational scientist and also a good team player, and you will be ready to move on to your next step's career.


 
Expectations of Postdoc Fellows
----
- Postdocs are incentivized to reach career milestones and publish papers and dive into a specific reserach question deeply. 
Please feel free to communicate with me on your thoughts on your current projects, future skills you'd like to develop, your long-term career goals. 
- It usually takes one or two years to publish your first first-authored paper and send your second first/co-first authored paper for review on the second or third year.
- Once you submit your first first-authored paper, please seek out opportunities to present your work to the national and/or international community to communicate with more folks in simiar fields. 
- We highly encourage postdoc fellows to write grant proposals and apply for external fundings, like K grants, PhRMA grants, CCTSI and local pilot grants.
- As a postdoc fellow, demonstrating your independence, leadership, and mentoring capability is important to move on to your next career stage in either academia or industry. I will introduce you to other collaboration projects if you have the bandwith (if you can make good progress on your independent projects) in order to enhance your expertise of leading a multi-site project if available.
- We recommend you considering looking for jobs when your second paper is sent for review.
- For job application, please consult with me on your application materials, recommendation letter, and job talk rehearsal as I can provide considerable assistance in this regard.

Prof. Zhang is happy to help revise your manuscript and abstract drafts and provide detailed guidance on presentations.


Presenting your research
-------
Once your work has been selected for a talk for a research conference, you need to prepare your presentation and do rehersals once in the lab. This can help you enhance your logic, manage presenting timing, practice question handling skills, and build your confidence. 

General tips: 
- Each slide should convey one clear message.
- The slide title should state the key message.
- Use large, easy-to-read fonts.
- Favor plots and figures over text whenever possible.
- Engage your audience by posing motivating questions during the presentation.




Writing/Publishing a paper
-------
- We conduct publishing-driven, impactful research. Each paper should thoughtfully address at least one scientific question and overcome a key computational challenge.
- For computational biology or method-development papers, we perform thorough benchmarking across multiple real-world datasets and compare against existing approaches. Our goal is to create methods/tools that are generalizable and useful across related fields.
- For translational or disease-focused papers, we aim for statistically robust conclusions through accurate data modeling. Beyond producing analyses or pipelines, we also strive to propose testable hypotheses and provide reproducible code to facilitate communication with immunologists and rheumatologists and enhance translational impact.
- We use Google Drive to organize manuscript preparation, including Google Docs for manuscript writing and Paperpile for reference management.
- Please discuss publishing strategies with me early in the process so we can plan efficiently and strategically.
