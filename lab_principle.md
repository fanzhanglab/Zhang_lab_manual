# Lab principle #

**We believe in collaborations, encourage sharing, promote diversity, and maintain scientific integraity to pursue high-quality science.**


#### We believe in collaborations
- We welcome our lab memebers seek out mutually beneficial collaboration opportunities.
- Any new collaborations should be discussed with Prof. Zhang prior to accepting the project in order to ensure trainee priorities, time management, appropriate negotiation of authorship, project timeline, and proper funding.


#### We encourage sharing 
- Every lab member will share code, data, and relevant lab materials to the Open Access standard based on our best abilities upon publicatoins.
- For unpublished lab materials (code, software, pipeline, data, manuscript drafts, and grants), we encourage everyone share within lab, and it is possible to share with others outside the lab upon prior approval by Prof. Zhang and all involved contributors and collaborators.


#### We believe that diversity makes better science
- We value inclusive and diverse research environment.
- To promote high quality research, we welcome all trainees from different reserach backgrounds, different countries, different races, etc.


#### We maintain scientific integrity and ethics
- Maintaining high standards of scientific integrity and ethics is essential to the biomedical research.
- Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, which are not allowed.
