# Lab activity #

#### Lab meeting 
- Lab meetings will be held one hour per week to be determined to best accomodate the schedules of the majority of current lab members. 
- All lab members are expected to attend our lab meeting.
- Everyone will iteratively present their reserach project progresses at lab meeting.
- Please contact Prof. Zhang in advance if someone is not able to attend due to research business like attending conference or training, etc.


#### Subgroup meeting
- Besides weekly lab meetings, we also organize two subgroup meetings based on our lab's research interests.
- Each lab member needs to select one subgroup meeting based on their own research interests and career development goals.
- The two subgroup meetings are: 1) single-cell multi-omics and 2) systems immunology and biology in immune-mediated diseases.
- Subgroup meetings offer a great opportunity to enhance your knowledge of a particular field through discussing any of your challenges, questions, progresses, and brain-stormings on your project.


#### One-on-one meeting
- Weekly one-on-one meetings will be held for each member when they join the lab. 
- Every member will be assigned one or two major projects.
- We track everyone's progressed on specific tasks using Trello. So we can generate "TODO" list on everyone's Trello project board after each one-on-one meeting, and we mark the tasks as "Done" by examing it on our next one-on-one meeting. We will break down a "big task" into multiple measureable "small tasks".


#### Flexible working mode
- We offer dry lab space where you can conduct your productive research.
- We believe in each lab memberâ€™s ability to best manage their own schedules and complete their research projects and advance their careers. 
- We encourge being on campus between 10:00am and 5:00pm most days will help facilitate collaborative working and get your problems solved in a more efficient manner.
